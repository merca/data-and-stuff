## 🧐 About


In this repository, you'll find the relics of my expeditions into the uncharted territories of data engineering, architecture, analysis, and science.


## 🏁 Getting Started

To embark upon this quest, ensure your steed (your machine) is equipped with the necessary armaments.

### Prerequisites


Infrastructure is written with Pulumi, so you'll need to install it.

```powershell
# Install necessary tools
choco install pulumi
```

### Installing

Clone the repository to have the map of this digital realm.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/merca/data-and-stuff.git
cd data-and-stuff
```

## 🔧 Running the tests

Invoke the spells to summon the testing spirits.

```sh
# Run the tests

dotnet test

```

## 🎈 Usage

With the repository cloned and your machine prepared, you may now delve into the scripts and notebooks, each a tome of data incantations.

## 🚀 Deployment

Deploying your findings to the live system is akin to placing the flag upon the conquered fortress.

## ⛏️ Built Using
